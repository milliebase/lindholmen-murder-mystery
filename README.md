## Mystery
Sherlock Kristianson is a new detective at the Gothenburg police force and has been delegated the task of solving the case where a dead persons body has been found in the river “Göta älv” in the city center.

The dead person is unidentified, but from the water-damaged reciept found in his pocket you can tell he has been eating a vegetarian lunch the __27th of october 2019__. He payed __79 SEK__ per dish and payed for two.

You, as a SQL-master, need to help Sherlock solve the mystery and find both the victim and murderer.

__Good luck!__
